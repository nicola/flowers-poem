# POEM: 9*19 Flowers

A love poem that mix visualization art and code poetry. Probably the first poem written in git commits.

- [See the Visualization](https://nicola.github.io/poem-flowers) (and interact with it)
- [Read the Code](https://github.com/nicola/flowers-poem/blob/poem/poem/flowers.html) (in its readable poetic form)
- [Read the Poem](https://github.com/nicola/flowers-poem/commits/poem) (in the commit history)

Inspired and based on [Jason Davies work](http://www.jasondavies.com/rhodonea/)

## The Poem

The poem is about preparing a field to grow flowers and making sure that each flower has a beautiful color. These flowers  will shine when seen by the beloved and turn gray when touched. They keep asking to be touched again.

Since in a computer virtual world everything is possible and nothing is real, the lover will *handcraft* flowers from *maths and lines*.

It is possible to read the poem in the commit history in the [poem branch](https://github.com/nicola/flowers-poem/commits/poem).

```
$ git fetch origin poem
$ git checkout poem
$ git log --format="%s"

## The Visualization

1. Colors are randomly generated. The function `beautiful_color()` makes sure that the lover handcrafts the most beautiful flowers.
2. When flowers are touched they get colourful. When a single one is touched, it changes shape.

### The mathematics behind the flowers

The flowers are generated mathematically. The first grid that appears is a matrix, where flowers are generated using the value of their column and row positions.

The mathematical formula is very simple. I define curves to be 

```
r = cos(kt)

where r = cos(kt)
```

As soon as we land in the visualisation there is a diagonal line towards the matrix. When the column and row number are the same, `k = 1` and therefore we get the identity flower, considered in the code to be *the ugly flower* that the lover deletes. It looks like this:

![Identity flower](documentation/identity.png?raw=true "Identity flower")

Where as soon as we play with `k`, for example `k = 2/1` we get the second flower.

![k2](documentation/k2.png?raw=true "k2")
